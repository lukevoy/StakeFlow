# StakeFlow

Cross-chain staking optimizer with automated yield management and dynamic strategy adjustment.

## Overview

StakeFlow is an intelligent staking protocol that monitors APR across multiple chains (ETH, SUI, APT, etc.) and automatically adjusts staking positions to maximize yield.

## Features

- Multi-chain staking pool discovery and monitoring
- Automated rebalancing when APR differentials exceed thresholds
- Compound interest through periodic reward harvesting
- Real-time yield curve and asset distribution dashboard
